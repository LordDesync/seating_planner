# Seating Planner
Program to assist in creating seating plans for various events.

Written as part of an A-Level qualification.
I have never been formally taught Python; if you look at my source code, I am taking no responsibility for any damage done to brain.
Also have never used github before, so I've probably messed it up somehow.

## Program Usage

  ENTER:
      MAXIMUM NUMBER OF GUESTS PER TABLE AT THE TOP.
      NAME OF GUEST IN "NAMES" COLUMN.
      EACH GUEST'S PREFERENCES (WHO THEY WOULD LIKE TO SIT WITH) IN THE "PREFERENCES" COLUMNS.

  "EXECUTE" TO GENERATE SEATING PLAN. MAY TAKE SOME TIME TO COMPLETE COMPUTATION.
  "CLEAR ALL" DELETES *ALL* USER INPUT DATA. EXCERCISE SUITABLE CAUTION.

  PLEASE DISTINGUISH BETWEEN GUESTS WITH IDENTICAL FIRST NAMES WHERE APPLICABLE; USE "JOE A" AND "JOE B".
  ADDITIONALLY, ALL ENTRIES IN ANY COLUMN OR ROW ARE CASE SENSITIVE. TAKE CARE WHEN ENTERING DATA.
  USING SPECIAL CHARACTERS (#,",```...) MAY POSSIBLY CAUSE UNDOCUMENTED BEHAVIOUR.

| NOT ENOUGH DATA   	| THE NUMBER ENTERED AT THE TOP IS GREATER THAN THE NUMBER OF GUESTS.<br>PLEASE NOTE THAT THE NUMBER AT THE TOP IS THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF GUESTS *PER TABLE*, AND NOT TOTAL NUMBER OF GUESTS. 	|   	|   	|   	|

#KNOWN ̶I̶S̶S̶U̶E̶S *INTENDED FEATURES*

  DUE TO THE INHERENT UNPREDICTABLE VARIATION OF INPUT, THE PROGRAM MAY OCCASIONALLY OUTPUT VERY SMALL TABLES.
  THESE ARE GENERALLY EASILY FIXED MANUALLY, AS OTHER GENERATED TABLES USUALLY HAVE SPARE SEATS.

  DUE TO COMPUTATIONAL LIMITATIONS AND TIME COMPLEXITY, IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PRODUCE AN ABSOLUTE OPTIMAL SOLUTION.
  (SEE BIG O NOTATION AND SET PARTITIONING PROBLEM/K-COLOUR VERTEX COLOURING PROBLEM).
  THIS PROGRAM WILL GENERATE A "GOOD" BUT NOT NECESSARILY OPTIMAL SOLUTION. MAKE MODIFICATIONS TO INAPPROPRIATE TABLES AT YOUR DISCRETION.
  PROGRAM MAY TAKE SEVERAL SECONDS TO PRODUCE A RESULT, PARTICULARLY FOR LARGE EVENTS (>500 GUESTS).

  IF YOU ENCOUNTER A BUG NOT MENTIONED, IT IS NOW A FEATURE.
