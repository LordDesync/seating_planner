# Seating Planner
Program to assist in creating seating plans for various events.

Written as part of an A-Level qualification.<br>
I have never been formally taught Python; if you look at my source code, I am taking no responsibility for any damage done to brain.<br>
Also have never used github before, so I've probably messed it up somehow.

## Program Usage

Enter:<br>
- Maximum number of guests per table at the top.<br>
- Name of guests in "names" column.<br>
- Each guest's preferences (who they would like to sit with, 3 maximum) in the "preferences" columns.<br>

- "Execute" to generate seating plan. May take some time to complete computation.<br>
- "Clear All" deletes *ALL* user input data. Excercise suitable caution.

Please distinguish between guests with identical first names where applicable; i.e.  use "Joe A" and "Joe B".<br>
Additionally, all entries in any column or row are case sensitive. Take care when entering data.<br>
Using special characters (#,",```,...) may possibly cause undocumented behaviour.<br>

## TROUBLESHOOTING

| ERROR MESSAGE     	| METHOD                                                                                                                                                                                     	|
|-------------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| INPUT ERROR       	| MAX SEATING PER TABLE MUST BE ENTERED IN ARABIC NUMERALS; 1,2,3...<br>DO NOT USE COMMAS OR PERIODS.                                                                                        	|
| TABLES MUST BE >2 	| PROGRAM ONLY SUPPORTS TABLES OF SIZE 3 OR GREATER<br>WORKAROUND: IF SMALLER TABLES ARE ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED, INPUT TWICE THE SIZE OF EACH TABLE, THEN SPLIT EACH TABLE.                     	|
| NOT ENOUGH DATA   	| THE NUMBER ENTERED AT THE TOP IS GREATER THAN THE NUMBER OF GUESTS.<br>PLEASE NOTE THAT THE NUMBER AT THE TOP IS THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF GUESTS *PER TABLE*, AND NOT TOTAL NUMBER OF GUESTS. 	| 
| INVALID PREFERENCE    | THERE IS A PREFERENCE WHICH IS NOT ADDED AS A GUEST; e.g;<br>GUEST A WANTS TO SIT WITH GUEST B, BUT GUEST B IS NOT ENTERED IN THE NAMES COLUMN                                              | 

## KNOWN ̶I̶S̶S̶U̶E̶S *INTENDED FEATURES*

Due to the inherent unpredictable variation of input, the program may occasionally output very small tables.<br>
These are generally easily fixed manually, as at least one other generated table will usually have spare seats.<br>

Due to computational limitations and time complexity, it is not feasible to produce an absolute optimal solution.<br>
(See Big O notation and Set Partitioning problem/K-Colour Vertex Colouring problem)<br>
This program will generate a "good" but not necessarily optimal solution. Make modifications to inappropriate tables at your discretion.
Program may take several seconds to produce a result, particularly for large events (>500 guests).

If you encounter a bug not mentioned, it is now a feature.
