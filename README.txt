# Seating Planner
Program to assist in creating seating plans for various events.

Written as part of an A-Level qualification.
I have never been formally taught Python; if you look at my source code, I am taking no responsibility for any damage done to brain.
Also have never used github before, so I've probably messed it up somehow.
