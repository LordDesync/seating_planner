Desync's Seating Planner
Program to assist in creating seating plans for various events.

===============
PROGRAM USAGE

  ENTER:
      MAXIMUM NUMBER OF GUESTS PER TABLE AT THE TOP.
      NAME OF GUEST IN "NAMES" COLUMN.
      EACH GUEST'S PREFERENCES (WHO THEY WOULD LIKE TO SIT WITH) IN THE "PREFERENCES" COLUMNS.

  "EXECUTE" TO GENERATE SEATING PLAN. MAY TAKE SOME TIME TO COMPLETE COMPUTATION.
  "CLEAR ALL" DELETES *ALL* USER INPUT DATA. EXCERCISE SUITABLE CAUTION.

  PLEASE DISTINGUISH BETWEEN GUESTS WITH IDENTICAL FIRST NAMES WHERE APPLICABLE; USE "JOE A" AND "JOE B".
  ADDITIONALLY, ALL ENTRIES IN ANY COLUMN OR ROW ARE CASE SENSITIVE. TAKE CARE WHEN ENTERING DATA.
  USING SPECIAL CHARACTERS (#,",```...) MAY POSSIBLY CAUSE UNDOCUMENTED BEHAVIOUR.

TROUBLESHOOTING
			|
    ERROR MESSAGE	|  METHOD
  ______________________|______________________ _ _ _
			|
    INPUT ERROR		|  MAX SEATING PER TABLE MUST BE ENTERED IN ARABIC NUMERALS; 1,2,3...
			|  DO NOT USE COMMAS OR PERIODS.
			|
    TABLES MUST BE >2	|  PROGRAM ONLY SUPPORTS TABLES OF SIZE 3 OR GREATER
			|  IF SMALLER TABLES ARE ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED, INPUT TWICE THE SIZE OF EACH TABLE, THEN SPLIT EACH TABLE.
			|
    NOT ENOUGH DATA	|  THE NUMBER ENTERED AT THE TOP IS GREATER THAN THE NUMBER OF GUESTS.
			|  PLEASE NOTE THAT THE NUMBER AT THE TOP IS THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF GUESTS *PER TABLE*, AND NOT NUMBER OF GUESTS
			|
    INVALID PREFERENCE	|  THERE IS A PREFERENCE WHICH IS NOT ADDED AS A GUEST; e.g;
			|  GUEST A WANTS TO SIT WITH GUEST B, BUT GUEST B IS NOT ENTERED IN THE NAMES COLUMN

KNOWN ̶I̶S̶S̶U̶E̶S *INTENDED FEATURES*

  DUE TO THE INHERENT UNPREDICTABLE VARIATION OF INPUT, THE PROGRAM MAY OCCASIONALLY OUTPUT VERY SMALL TABLES.
  THESE ARE GENERALLY EASILY FIXED MANUALLY, AS OTHER GENERATED TABLES USUALLY HAVE SPARE SEATS.

  DUE TO COMPUTATIONAL LIMITATIONS AND TIME COMPLEXITY, IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PRODUCE AN ABSOLUTE OPTIMAL SOLUTION.
  (SEE BIG O NOTATION AND SET PARTITIONING PROBLEM/K-COLOUR VERTEX COLOURING PROBLEM).
  THIS PROGRAM WILL GENERATE A "GOOD" BUT NOT NECESSARILY OPTIMAL SOLUTION. MAKE MODIFICATIONS TO INAPPROPRIATE TABLES AT YOUR DISCRETION.
  PROGRAM MAY TAKE SEVERAL SECONDS TO PRODUCE A RESULT, PARTICULARLY FOR LARGE EVENTS (>500 GUESTS).

  IF THE PROGRAM DOES NOT RETURN A RESULT WITHIN ~10 SECONDS FOR UNDER 100 GUESTS,
  PLEASE SEND A COPY OF THE INPUT DATA (SEE BELOW, UNDER "CONTACT") TO ASSIST WITH DEBUGGING.
